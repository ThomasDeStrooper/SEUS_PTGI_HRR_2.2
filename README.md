## About
**SEUS PTGI HRR 2.2** is an edit of the popular SEUS PTGI HRR 2.1 shader by Sonic Ether. My goal with this edit is to enhance the SEUS PTGI HRR shader by improving both its quality and performance.
Please note that I do not, and will never, make money from this shader edit. I do this purely out of my passion for the shader and my love for editing shaders.

## Importand
Installation Instructions:

1. Extract the 'SEUS PTGI HRR 2.2' zip file.
2. Ensure OptiFine is installed before proceeding.
3. Open the extracted folder and double-click the 'Install' file.
4. That's it! You're ready to go!

## DISCLAIMER: Optifine is required! 
To get the best performance with SEUS PTGI, make sure you're using OptiFine!  
If you're currently using Fabric, switch to Forge! It's more compatible with the shader and gives better performance overall.

Profiles:

The shader pack includes two profiles: Stable and Quality.
- Stable (Default): Enhances the overall image quality without applying a sharpness filter, resulting in a smoother, more natural look.
- Quality: Applies a sharpness filter to make the game appear crisper. However, this can sometimes produce harsh or unnatural effects on certain blocks, which may look odd in specific scenarios.
- Experimental: Based on the Stable profile but includes bug fixes that may slightly reduce performance.

For the best balance of visual fidelity and consistency, we recommend using the Stable profile.

I've also provided a funding link where you can support the original shader's creator, Sonic Ether.

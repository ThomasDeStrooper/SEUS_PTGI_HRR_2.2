## About
**SEUS PTGI HRR 2.2** is an edit of the popular SEUS PTGI HRR 2.1 shader by Sonic Ether. My goal with this edit is to enhance the SEUS PTGI HRR shader by improving both its quality and performance.
Please note that I do not, and will never, make money from this shader edit. I do this purely out of my passion for the shader and my love for editing shaders.

## Importand
There are two profiles to choose from. By default, it's set to 'Custom,' so you'll need to switch to it in order to access the custom features!
I've also provided a funding link where you can support the original shader's creator, Sonic Ether.

## Features Include:
- **Performance & Quality Profiles** - There are two profiles to choose from. By default, it's set to 'Custom,' so you'll need to switch to it in order to access the custom features!
- **Improved Quality** - We've enhanced the quality to reduce blurriness and make it sharper, now almost matching the quality of SEUS PTGI E12!
- **Improved Performance** - We've significantly improved the performance, making it smoother and more efficient than ever before!
  
## Features Coming Soon:
- **Better Reflections** - Some reflections may be missing due to optimization, which can occasionally cause odd visual effects!
- **Better Vibrant Colors** - We'll be enhancing the default colors of the shader to make them more vibrant and dynamic!
